# PiCar-X — ITAI2374 Project

### 1. Introduction

The Picar-X is a small mobile robot built with a Raspberry Pi. It can move on its own and detect obstacles using Python and its built-in sensors. This makes it a simple and practical way to learn how robots sense their environment and make decisions to navigate safely.

### 2. Goal

The goal of this project is to create an affordable robot that can move around safely in a controlled indoor environment. The robot is designed to detect obstacles in its path and react appropriately by using simple control programs. This project allows hands-on learning of how robots sense their surroundings, make decisions, and carry out basic autonomous navigation in a safe and practical way.

### 3. Methodology

### Hardware
Raspberry Pi
Picar-X chassis
