Project: PiCar-X Robotics
Author: Rodrigo Sierra
Professional Profile
Consultant with 15 years of experience in SAP HCM, SAP processes, process management, strategic planning, human resources, change management, project coordination, and ERP system implementation at national and international levels. Currently expanding knowledge in Artificial Intelligence through an A.A.S. program at Houston Community College, gaining practical experience in robotics (via PICAR-X) and other AI-related subjects such as machine learning, automation, and data analysis.

I bring strong skills in team management, problem-solving, leadership, customer focus, and communication, complemented by foundational AI knowledge and hands-on practice. This combination allows me to understand and contribute to technology-driven initiatives while leveraging my extensive expertise in enterprise systems and process optimization.

During the Robotics course, I gained practical knowledge and applied concepts from modules such as Introduction to Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Sensors and Perception, Robot Kinematics & Motion, Actuators and Control Systems, and ROS 2 Integration while developing the Picar-X project. This hands-on experience allowed me to understand the integration of sensors, actuators, and software for executing robotic tasks, reinforcing both my theoretical understanding and practical skills. The competencies I acquired through this project serve as a solid foundation for future robotics projects, enabling me to further explore autonomous systems, AI integration, and advanced robotic applications.
